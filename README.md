As part of Tinker-her-hack 2.0, a 12 hour hackathon conduted, we the team RARE consisting of four members including myself created a website as a part of a hackathon for pregnant women that allows them to chat with doctors about the small queries they have during their pregnancy. the aim of the website is to reduce unwanted visits to the doctor, which saves time for both the doctor and patient. the features  of the website: this website link will be displayed in all the hospital websites and the home page will be visible to all users whether registered or not. In order to login to the website, the patient must register under a doctor in a particular hospital for 10 months completely , till the delivery. the doctor then provides login credentials to this patient who will be able to login to the website. A registered user will be directed to a page where options for chat with the registered doctor, emergency call to the assistant doctors, video call and a page to keep track of the consistent medicine intake of the patient implemented using a calendar. on the doctors side, we are planning to implement a chat app with notification features, where each doctor receives the chats only from the patients registered under them for consultancy.
